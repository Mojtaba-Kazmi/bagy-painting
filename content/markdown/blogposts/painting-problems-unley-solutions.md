## Top Painting Problems Faced by Unley Residents and How to Solve Them

Unley, with its tree-lined streets and mix of heritage and modern homes, is one of Adelaide’s most charming suburbs. However, homeowners in Unley often encounter specific painting challenges that can impact the longevity and appearance of their properties.

In this blog, we’ll explore the most common painting problems faced by Unley residents and how **Bagy Painting**, a trusted local painting service, provides effective solutions.

### 1. Managing Paint in Heritage Properties

Unley is known for its beautiful heritage homes, but maintaining the paintwork on these properties can be tricky. Old surfaces, intricate details, and strict heritage regulations often pose challenges.

**Solution:**  
Professional painters like **Bagy Painting** specialise in heritage properties, using careful preparation techniques and heritage-approved paints. Our team ensures every detail is preserved while giving your home a fresh, vibrant look.

### 2. Fading and Peeling Paint Due to Weather

The Unley climate, with its hot summers and occasional wet winters, can cause exterior paint to fade, crack, or peel over time. This not only affects your home’s appearance but also its protection against the elements.

**Solution:**  
We use premium, weather-resistant paints that are specifically designed to withstand Adelaide’s climate. With proper surface preparation and high-quality materials, we ensure your home stays protected and looking great for years.

### 3. Colour Selection Challenges

Unley’s mix of classic and contemporary homes makes it challenging to choose the right colour palette that complements your property and the surrounding area.

**Solution:**  
Our professional painters offer expert **colour consultation services** to help you find the perfect palette for your home. Whether you want a timeless, elegant look or something modern and bold, we guide you to the best choice for your style and property type.

### 4. Dealing with High-Traffic Areas

In homes with active families or businesses in Unley, walls in high-traffic areas often suffer from scuff marks, stains, and wear and tear.

**Solution:**  
We recommend durable, washable paints for busy areas, ensuring that walls remain easy to clean and maintain. These paints not only provide a polished finish but also stand up to everyday use.

### 5. Fixing Pre-Painting Issues

Before any painting project, issues like mould, mildew, and cracked surfaces need to be addressed. These problems are common in areas of Unley with older homes or shaded properties.

**Solution:**  
**Bagy Painting** focuses on thorough surface preparation, including cleaning, repairing cracks, and treating mould before painting. This guarantees a smooth, long-lasting finish that keeps your home safe and beautiful.
